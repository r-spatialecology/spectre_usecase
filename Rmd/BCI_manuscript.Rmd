## Assessing the performance of spectre using the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) tree data set

We will use the Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Condit et al. 2019) data set to assess the performance of spectre under different parameterisations. 
We arbitrarily choose tree stem data set number 8. 

* TODO: add BCI data description   

We will vary three parameters:

* number of sites/cells, from 30 to 150 
* gamma, the maximum number of species, from 25 to 300
* the number of iterations of the spectre algorithm (10k and 40k)

For each parameterisation we want to run 3 replicates.

### Using subsamples of the BCI data set to assess algorithm performance
We sample a random subset of sites, and from that subset we sample gamma species, if possible. 
If the number of present species in the sampled sites is smaller than gamma, we skip this parameter combination and continue with the next one.
From the subset, we calculate the target commonness matrix and the $\alpha$-diversity per site, both used as input for the spectre algorithm.
The algorithm aims to generate a solution that fulfills the two constraints given by the target commonness matrix and the $\alpha$-diversity per site. 
By comparing the target commonness matrix and the generated solution, we can assess the algorithms performance in XX ways. 

* TODO: add error measure descriptions here

#### Results 
Most spectre-generated solutions were better after 40k iterations than after 10k. 
Given 40k iterations, spectre generated solutions for up to 150 sites and a gamma of 250 species with a $MAE_{commonness}$ < 1 (Fig. \ref{fig:mae_commonness}). 

```{r mae_commonness, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:mae_commonness} Mean absolute error in commonness for random subsamples of the BCI data set. ", out.width = '75%'}
